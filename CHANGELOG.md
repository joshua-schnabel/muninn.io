# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The release pipeline reads the version from this file — see
[`docs/ci-cd.md`](docs/ci-cd.md). Never hand-push a `v*` tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository skeleton: ignore rules, LF line-ending policy, MIT licence.
- Cargo workspace of five crates — `muninn`, `muninn-core`, `muninn-telegraf`,
  `muninn-modules`, `muninn-health` — with module contracts documented and no
  implementation yet.
- Stable exit codes in `muninn-core::exit`, with tests. Shipped ahead of the
  implementation because they are an operator-facing contract.
- Schema V1 example configurations: annotated, minimal and integration.
- `docs/reference/telegraf.reference.conf` — the Telegraf configuration the
  renderer must produce, verified against Telegraf 1.39.2 with
  `telegraf config check` (exit 0) before any renderer code exists.
- `docs/reference/ordering-{correct,broken}.conf` — fixtures for the sub-table
  ordering rule.
- Twelve architecture decision records.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — work packages WP0–WP12 with scope and definition of done.
- `docs/analysis/huginn-review.md` — what huginn.io contributes and what was
  deliberately rejected.
- `docs/spikes/updates-spike.md` — plan and test matrix for reading host package
  state from a container.
- Reference documentation: architecture, configuration, modules, rendering,
  supervision, host mounts, hardening, testing, versioning, CI/CD, risks.

### Notes

Nothing is released yet. `muninn` builds but exits immediately with a pointer to
the roadmap — WP0 is a design package, not a working agent.

Three findings during WP0 changed the design away from the project brief:

- Validation uses `telegraf config check`, not `--test`, so it never binds the
  port the real process needs.
- Exclusion options do not exist on the relevant plugins and must render as
  `tagdrop` sub-tables, which forces a declared render order rather than sorted
  keys.
- There is no `inputs.load`; the `load` and `system` modules merge into one
  plugin instance.
